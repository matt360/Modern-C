	 *Providing a definition for a pure virtual function is valid, as long as it is not defined directly in the function declaration. So defining Base::f() outside of Base is ok.

	[class.abstract]§13.4¶2 in the C++ standard:

	A pure virtual function need be defined only if called with, or as if with (§15.4), the qualified-id syntax (§8.1).

	This implicitly says that a pure virtual function can in fact be defined. Furthermore:

	A function declaration cannot provide both a pure-specifier and a definition

	Which is why we have to define it outside the declaration[1]. Now to the output of the program:

	object.f() calls Derived::f(), returning 2.

	((Base&)object).f() casts object to a Base& before calling f(), but since f() is a virtual function, Derived::f() is still called, returning 2.

	[1]: This is a non-normative note; the actual normative wording that disallows it is the grammar for a function-definition does not include a pure-specifier.
