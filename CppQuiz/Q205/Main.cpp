	/*
	array is an array of unsigned char, but is initialized with unsigned ints. The unsigned ints have to be converted to unsigned chars, so we might expect a narrowing diagnostic. [dcl.init.aggr]§11.6.1¶3 in the standard says:

    (...) If the initializer-clause is an expression and a narrowing conversion (§11.6.4) is required to convert the expression, the program is ill-formed. (...)

	[dcl.init.list]§11.k.4¶7 tells us what a narrowing conversion is:

    A narrowing conversion is an implicit conversion (...) from an integer type (...) to an integer type that cannot represent all the values of the original type

	An unsigned char cannot represent all the values of an unsigned int, so we would normally expect a diagnostic. However, the above clause continues with an exception for the case where the source is a constant expression whose value after promotion fits in the target type:

    except where the source is a constant expression whose value after integral promotions will fit into the target type.

	So since id is constexpr, and both id % 3 and id % 5 fits in an unsigned char, the program is well-formed.
