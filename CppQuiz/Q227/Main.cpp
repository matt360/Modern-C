	using Func = int() is an alias-declaration introducing the typedef-name Func for a function taking no parameters and returning an int.

	This typedef-name can be used both for free functions and, as in this question, for member functions. [class.mfct]§12.2.1¶8 in the C++ standard:

    [Note: A member function can be declared (but not defined) using a typedef for a function type. The resulting member function has exactly the same type as it would have if the function declarator were provided explicitly

	The use of Func f in struct S is therefore equivalent to int f().
