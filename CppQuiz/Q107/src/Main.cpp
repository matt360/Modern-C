	The goal of this question is to demonstrate that the evaluation order of elements in an initializer list is specified (as opposed to the arguments to a function call).

	[dcl.init.list]§11.6.4¶4: Within the initializer-list of a braced-init-list, the initializer-clauses, including any that result from pack expansions (§17.5.3), are evaluated in the order in which they appear.

	If h took two ints instead of a vector<int>, and was called like this:
	h(f(), g());
	the program would be unspecified, and could either print fg or gf.
