	[basic.start.dynamic]§6.6.3¶4 in the standard:
	"It is implementation-defined whether the dynamic initialization of a non-local non-inline variable with static storage duration is sequenced before the first statement of main or is deferred. If it is deferred, it strongly happens before any non-initialization odr-use of any non-inline function or non-inline variable defined in the same translation unit as the variable to be initialized."

	Since A() is not constexpr, the initialization of a is dynamic. There are two possibilities:
	- a is initialized before main() is called, i.e. before b is initialized.
	- a is not initialized before main(). It is however guaranteed to be initialized before the the use of any function defined in the same translation unit, i.e. before the constructor of b is called.

	When execution reaches B b, it is initialized as normal. Static local variables are initialized the first time control passes through their declaration, so c is initialized next. As main() is exited, its local variable b goes out of scope, and is destroyed. Finally, all static variables are destroyed in reverse order of their initialization, first c, then a.
