	/*
	The first line in main(), X x; is straightforward, it calls the default constructor.

	The next two lines is the heart of the question: The difference between X y(x) and X z = y is not that the first calls the copy constructor, and the second calls the copy assignment operator. The difference is that the first is direct initialization ([dcl.init]§11.6¶16 in the standard) and the second is copy initialization ([dcl.init]§11.6¶15).

	[dcl.init]§11.6¶17 says: "If the initialization is direct-initialization, or if it is copy-initialization where the (...) source type is the same class as (...) the class of the destination, constructors are considered." So both our cases use the copy constructor.

	Not until z = x; do we have an actual assignment that uses the assignment operator.

	See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1051379/is-there-a-difference-in-c-between-copy-initialization-and-direct-initializati/1051468#1051468 for a more detailed discussion of direct vs. copy initialization.
