	a1 is default initialized, as described in [dcl.init]§11.6¶12.

	a2 doesn't actually use the initializer_list constructor with a list of zero elements, but the default constructor:
	[dcl.init.list]§11.6¶3:
	List-initialization of an object or reference of type T is defined as follows:
	- (...)
	- Otherwise, if the initializer list has no elements and T is a class type with a default constructor, the object is value-initialized.
	- Otherwise, if T is a specialization of std::initializer_list, the object is constructed as described below.

	a3's and a4's constructor is chosen in overload resolution, as described in [over.match.list]§16.3.1.7:

	"When objects of non-aggregate class type T are list-initialized (...), overload resolution selects the constructor in two	phases:
	— Initially, the candidate functions are the initializer-list constructors (§11.6.4) of the class T and the argument list	consists of the initializer list as a single argument.
	— If no viable initializer-list constructor is found, overload resolution is performed again, where the candidate functions are		all the constructors of the class T and the argument list consists of the elements of the initializer list."

	Initializer list constructors are greedy, so even though A(int) constructor is available, the standard mandates that initializer_list<int> is prioritized, and if - and only if - it's not available, the compiler is allowed to look for other constructors. (This is why it is not recommended to provide a constructor that ambiguously overloads with an initializer_list constructor. See the answer to #4 in http://herbsutter.com/2013/05/09/gotw-1-solution/ )
