	The issue here is not the missing initializer of the variable a - it will implicitly be initialized to 0 here. But the issue is the access to a twice without sequencing between the accesses. According to [intro.execution]§4.6¶14, accesses of volatile glvalues are side-effects and according to [intro.execution]§4.6¶17 these two unsequenced side-effects on the same memory location results in undefined behavior.
