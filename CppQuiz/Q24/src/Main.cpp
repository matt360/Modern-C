	Unsigned integers have well defined behaviour when they overflow. 
	When you go one above the largest representable unsigned int, you end up back at zero.

	According to [basic.fundamental]§6.9.1¶4 in the C++ standard: 
	"Unsigned integers, declared unsigned, 
	shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2^n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer."
