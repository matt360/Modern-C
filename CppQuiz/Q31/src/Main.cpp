	/*
	The compilation error is on the line y.f(), but the source of the problem is Y y(X());

	This could be interpreted as a a variable definition (which was the intention of the programmer in this example), 
	or as a definition of a function y, returning an object of type Y,
	taking a function (with no arguments, returning an object of type X) as its argument.

	The compiler is required by the standard to choose the second interpretation, 
	which means that y.f() does not compile (since y is now a function, not an object of type Y).

	Wikipedia has a concise explanation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse,
	and the standard has more in [stmt.ambig]§6.8.

	To fix the problem, change Y y(X()) to either Y y{X{}} (modern C++) or Y y((X())) (pre-C++11)
