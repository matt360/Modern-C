	To get to the bottom of this, we need to take a detour via function templates.

	According to [dcl.spec.auto]§10.1.7.4¶6 (auto specifier) in the standard:
	"The type of each declared variable is determined by placeholder type deduction (§10.1.7.4.1)."
	
	Placeholder type deduction works as per [dcl.type.auto.deduct]§10.1.7.4.1¶4 :
	
	    If the placeholder is the auto type-specifier, the deduced type T' replacing T is determined using the rules for template	argument deduction. (...) Deduce a value for U [the template parameter for the invented function] using the rules of  template argument deduction from a function call (§17.8.2.1) (...).
	
	So the rules for auto bar = a.getFoo(); are the same as if we did
	
	template<typename T> void f(T t);
	f(a.getFoo());
	
	Let's have a look at [temp.deduct.call]§17.8.2.1¶4:
	"In general, the deduction process attempts to find template argument values that will make the deduced A identical to A" (where	A is the type of the argument of the call.)
	
	Now what is the type of the argument of the call? getFoo() returns int&, but let's see what [expr]§5¶5 has to say about the type	of expressions:
	"If an expression initially has the type “reference to T”, the type is adjusted to T prior to any further analysis."
	
	So the type of the expression a.getFoo() that is used for deduction is int, not int&. Now int is being used for deducing T in our    imaginary void f(T t), so T is int. Since auto uses the same rule, the type of bar is also int.
	
	Since bar is not a reference, incrementing it does not increment foo, and the output of the program is 0.
