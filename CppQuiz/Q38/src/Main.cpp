	According to [dcl.type.simple]§10.1.7.2¶4 in the C++ standard:
	"The type denoted by decltype(e) is deﬁned as follows:
	- if e is an unparenthesized id-expression naming a structured binding ([dcl.struct.bind]§11.5), decltype(e) is the referenced	type as given in the specification of the structured binding declaration;
	— if e is an unparenthesized id-expression or an unparenthesized class member access ([expr.ref]§8.2.5), decltype(e) is the type	of the entity named by e. If there is no such entity, or if e names a set of overloaded functions, the program is ill-formed;
	— otherwise, if e is an xvalue, decltype(e) is T&&, where T is the type of e;
	— otherwise, if e is an lvalue, decltype(e) is T&, where T is the type of e;
	— otherwise, decltype(e) is the type of e."

	Because a is encapsulated in parentheses, it doesn't qualify for the first case, it is treated as an lvalue, therefore b's type is int&, not int.
