/*
COPYING AND COPY CONSTRUCTORS
Copying refers to copying data, copying memory, when we literaly want to copy one object, or primitive, or a piece of data, 
from one place to another, that we literally have to copied of it. A lot of the time we want to copy objects so we can modify them 
in certain ways, if we can avoid unnecessary copying, because we just want to read the value, we want to actually modify existing object,
we want to do it, because copying takes time.
Copying can be both a really use thing we actally need to make our programme work in a way we want it to, but on the flip side,
unnecessary copying is bad, and we want to avoid that, as much as possible, because it wastes performance.
So understanding how copying actually works in C++ and how to get it to work and also how to avoid 'getting it to work', and to avoid copying
when you don't want a copy is very important to understanding the language and being able to write C++ code efficiently and correctly.
